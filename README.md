# Dadjoke-gen

## Eh, why?

to make you suffer with me on my journy to learn golang. make sure to flame this garbage code as much as possible, so I can improve this piece of garbare in the future.

## Okay, but what does this do?

well the plan is to have a system that can handle data in the form of json. it should have full cli intregration and useability. in the future, I might add some kind of reddit post stealer, so I dont have to come up with dumb jokes to add...
since I've been only focused on the actual functionality of the system, it cant really do anything cool yet (because there is no command line madness lmao)
since it does work now, and jokes can be saved, removed, and edited, I should probably start work on the fun part now.
also, because I hate Tensorflow, I am going to TRY to write something along the lines of an AI to determine if a joke is funny enough to be put into the database, but I am not big-brained enough to do that yet. (if YOU are big-brained enough, likeeeee, hmu?)

## Well thats cool, but how do I use it?

just clone the bitch and cd into the directory of the thing u want to run. then, use the command:

```bash
go run .
```

to run the client, use the same command, but it will give a help-log, so you know exactly how to use it
Honnestly, I don't think you should run it at all, just look at the code and get seizures from the way I over-engineer my solutions lmao

## Some side-notes (just cuz)

I know the format of this project does not cohere to the standard golang specifications, buuuut idrgaf. I will probably fix it sometime later, but for now you are going to have to deal with my way of structure
